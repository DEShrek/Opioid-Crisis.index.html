        <h1>
          VA decreases patient opioid use by 55% in six years
        </h1>

        <p>
          WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Department of Veterans Affairs has reduced the number of its patients who use opioid and opioid-based medications for pain management.
        </p>

        <p>
          In fiscal year 2012, the VA reported more than 679,000 veterans were receiving prescriptions of opioid-based narcotics across the 146 VA medical clinics around the world. The number of veterans receiving the same treatments decreased to just over 305,000 by the end of fiscal year 2018. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The high-percentage decrease in opioid-based therapy stems from the VA’s Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI) of 2012. Although the VA has been looking into the use of opioids for pain management for more than 20 years, it wasn’t until the OSI’s announcement that it began an aggressive search for alternative therapy for pain patients.
        </p>

        <p>
          All 146 VA clinics have shown a significant change in the number of opioid-based prescriptions filled within the facility. However, not all clinics have shown promising results. Of the total number of clinics, only one, the Manila VA Clinic in the Philippines, has shown a negative percentage change; meaning the clinic prescribes more opioids now than it nearly 20 years ago.
        </p>

        <p>
          Excluding the outlier, the percentage of positive change ranges from more than 71 percent at the El Paso VA Clinic in Texas, to just over five percent at the Coatesville VA Medical Center in Pennsylvania – the average positive percentage of change is just under 45 percent overall.
        </p>

        <p>
          The VA continually builds on its guidelines from 2012 to help stem the epidemic of opioid use and opioid abuse and misuse among its veteran population. The clinics address these issues using four broad strategies: education, pain management, risk mitigation and addiction treatment. The VA focuses on the veteran’s whole health by using non-medicinal pain management treatments, self care and skill building. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The Opioid Safety Initiative has also decreased the number of veterans who are prescribed a combination of opioids and benzodiazepines, veterans who are prescribed opioids on a long-term basis (90 or more days) and veterans who continually receive very high doses of opioids, i.e., high-dose morphine. 
        </p>

        <p>
           Improvements in care and treatments reaches beyond the veterans and increases the knowledge-base of clinicians and support staff. Specially trained VA pharmacists have conduct outreach visits with VA staff on opioid safety, opioid overdose and naloxone distribution, and medication for opioid use disorder. VA healthcare providers are voluntarily participating in state-run prescription drug monitoring programs and regularly receive additional training on the safe use and prescribing of opioids and the opioid crisis as it continues even after the end of the Global War on Terrorism operations in the Middle East. 
         </p>
